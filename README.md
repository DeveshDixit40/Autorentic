# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was initialized using Create React App.

## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the application in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page refreshes automatically upon code modifications, and any linting errors will appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in an interactive watch mode.
Refer to the documentation for more details on running tests.

### `npm run build`

Generates a production-ready build in the `build` folder.

- Bundles React in production mode for optimal performance.
- Minifies the code and includes hashed filenames for cache management.
- The application is now ready for deployment.

Check the deployment section for further instructions.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning:** This action is irreversible!

If you need complete control over the build tools and configurations, you can eject at any time. This command:

- Removes the single build dependency.
- Copies all configuration files and dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.

Once ejected, you will manage these configurations manually.
Ejecting is optional and should only be used when necessary.
